'''
     Create a function that takes a student's name and their scores in different subjects as input.
    The function calculates the average score and prints the student's name, average, and a message indicating whether the student passed the exam (average >= 60) or failed.
    Create a for loop to iterate over a list of students and scores, calling the function for each student.
